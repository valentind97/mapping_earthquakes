### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.



### Main Objectives: 
* Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
* Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
* Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
* Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
* Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
* Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (d3) library.
* Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
* Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
* Render maps on a local server.
